## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works (App Logic)**
### **1. Data Management**
- The app uses a local database (e.g., SQLite or Room) to store all notes securely on the device.
- Each note contains:
  - **Title**: A short description of the note.
  - **Content**: The main body of the note.
  - **Timestamp**: Automatically generated when the note is created or modified.

### **2. CRUD Operations**
- **Create**: The user inputs a note title and content, which is saved to the database.
- **Read**: Notes are displayed in a list, fetched from the database.
- **Update**: Users can modify a saved note, and changes are updated in the database.
- **Delete**: Users can remove unwanted notes, which are permanently deleted from the database.

### **3. Search Algorithm**
- Implements a simple search logic to filter notes based on the title or content entered by the user.
